Main objective of this website to reduce the gap between donors and Recipients.
Link of this website : https://bloodconnect.w3spaces.com/test1.html
We mainly focus on the Access of Blood Donors to the Recipients. Due to lack of information about the Blood Donors, Recipients delayed to get the blood. Blood Donors has lack of information about Recipients to donate their blood to them.
The process of accessing blood products for a recipient typically involves a series of steps, including ordering the appropriate blood product, matching the product to the recipient's blood type, and ensuring that the product is stored and administered safely.
In both cases, access to blood donors and recipients is critical for ensuring the safety and efficacy of blood transfusions. By carefully screening donors and ensuring that blood products are matched appropriately to recipients.
how this webite useful?
Everyday around 12000 people in India die due to the sheer lack of donated blood in India. India collects around 11 million units of blood per year and needs around 15 million which is way too short for the demand.
This deaths also caused by lack of information between the Donors and Recievers.
So we have try to solve this problem by providing the donors information to the Recipients by creating a interactive Website to fulfill the gap between Donors and Recievers.
By using this website Reciever can obtain the Blood Donors around their location along with their Contact Details.
Currently we made the Prototype of this website. Consolidated to the few cities in the State of Andhra Pradesh.
We believe that the prototype can be the solution to this Problem of Blood Supply Shortage.
We still develop this website.
In future we can come with fully fucntional website..
